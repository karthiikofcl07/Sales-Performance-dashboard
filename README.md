📊 Sales Performance Dashboard Using Excel
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard developed using Microsoft Excel. The objective of this project is to analyze business sales data, extract meaningful insights, and present key performance metrics through a structured and visually professional dashboard. The dataset used for this analysis is the Superstore Sales Dataset obtained from Kaggle. The raw dataset was imported into Excel, cleaned, organized, and transformed into an interactive analytical dashboard using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers.

🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of Excel for business analytics. The project focuses on importing raw data, cleaning and structuring it properly, summarizing key business metrics, and building a clear and interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

🛠 Tools and Concepts Used

This project was completed entirely using Microsoft Excel. It covers Excel fundamentals including data formatting, sorting, filtering, and formula usage. Advanced features such as Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, slicers, and calculated fields were used to summarize and visualize business metrics. Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations were implemented to measure performance trends.

📊 Dashboard Summary

The dashboard highlights total revenue, total units sold, monthly sales trends, regional performance, and product category performance. Dynamic pivot tables were used to calculate summary metrics, while charts were created to visualize overall sales performance. Slicers were added to allow filtering by region and product category, enabling interactive analysis. MoM and YoY growth calculations provide additional insight into revenue trends and business performance changes over time.

🧹 Data Preparation Process

The dataset was imported into Excel and examined for missing values and inconsistencies. The data was formatted into structured tables to ensure accuracy and reliability. Necessary calculated columns were added to support metric analysis. Pivot tables were created to summarize revenue, units sold, and monthly trends, and these summaries were then used to design the final dashboard layout.

💼 Business Value

This project demonstrates how Excel can function as a powerful Business Intelligence tool for performance tracking and reporting. It showcases practical skills in data cleaning, analytical thinking, metric calculation, and professional dashboard design. The final output provides clear insights into sales performance and supports strategic decision-making.
